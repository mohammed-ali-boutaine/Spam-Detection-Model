loses customers who fear the company will be unable to make good on its obligations energy companies such as mirant corp and aquila inc have taken business elsewhere at enrononline the web site that once handled 2 8 billion in commodity transactions a day trading has plunged raising doubts that enron will be able to rescue the trading business enron once the largest energy trader sought protection yesterday from creditors in a bankruptcy that was the largest in u s history the company is in talks with financial institutions to fund the wholesale trading business under new ownership chief operating officer greg whalley said in a statement until we ve seen the fallout from this bankruptcy i don t think you re going to find a lot of entities that are prepared to trade with enron said daniel gordon head of commodities trading at hagerstown maryland based allegheny energy inc which owns utilities in five states anyone who thinks this will be a quick bankruptcy is deluding themselves houston based enron has lost 26 billion in market value since mid october when the company restated 586 million in earnings and disclosed that its executives may have profited from enron s dealings with affiliated partnerships that bought enron assets enron which was the buyer or seller on every transaction on its web site handles only a fraction of the trades it once did the company said today it will fire 4 000 workers in houston difficult to resurrect the wholesale trading business of enrononline which had been a valuable property has for all practical purposes ceased operation and in a post bankruptcy scenario may in fact be difficult to resurrect fitch inc a chicago based firm that rates corporate credit said in a report today trading has surged in markets that compete with enron including the new york mercantile exchange and intercontinental exchange inc dynegy inc chief executive officer chuck watson said his company s energy trading web site has seen increased traffic enrononline will just disappear said peter fusaro president of global change associates inc a consulting firm in new york enron s portfolio of trades is evaporating and is replaceable with competing electronic trading platforms dynegy s watson said on a conference call with analysts and investors that his company would try to expand in europe where enron was the dominant energy trader enron said friday it would fire more than 1 000 workers in europe shutdown enrononline shut down wednesday after dynegy canceled its plans to buy enron depriving enron of the cash it needed to meet its obligations and all but ensuring the company would be forced to seek protection from its creditors later in the week the site was offering trading in 472 commodity products a third of its usual offerings according to company officials on thursday the site logged 825 trades down from the normal amount of about 5 000 we re actively trading enron spokesman eric thode said today declining to elaborate there may still be trading going on but it s primarily to unwind positions fitch credit analyst ralph pellecchia said it s certainly not new growth or for profitability for all intents and purposes enron s horsepower its earnings generating machine has been effectively shut down needs capital enron declined to name the leading financial institutions it is in talks with to provide new capital for the trading business if these discussions are successful they could result in the creation of a new trading entity with a strong and unencumbered balance sheet whalley said we understand that it may take time for counterparties to resume normal trading levels with this entity but we are confident that this business can be put back on a solid footing enron s top creditors include citigroup inc s citibank and j p morgan chase co the blackstone group is helping enron with its financial restructuring a revival of enron s trading business isn t likely anytime soon analysts said it may take months to years if ever said david chang manager of natural gas trading at bank of america na in the meantime enron has alienated a lot of its suppliers and customers he said it would be difficult for enron to come back stopped shipping nisource inc which operates 16 000 miles of gas pipelines stopped shipping enron s gas on saturday because of credit concerns company spokesman kelly merritt said williams cos which controls 27 000 miles of pipes stopped shipping enron s gas last week enron has lost all credibility fusaro said in the meantime some traders that had become accustomed to the ease and speed of online transactions are finding it difficult to adjust kevin cokinos co owner and vice president at cokinos energy corp in houston said he has had to rely on his old network of telephone brokers for price quotes rather than enron s web site it s hard to do as many deals because you re spending so much more time on each one said cokinos whose company trades about 500 million cubic feet of gas a day we hope somebody picks up enrononline so it will come back the way it operated before but that might be kind of tough bradley keoun in the new york newsroom 212 318

bankrupt energy business richard ryan chief executive of an oak brook illinois company called standard power skilling who stunned investors when he quit in august six months after becoming ceo picked up 76 1 million employees and investors have sued enron accusing executives of selling shares while touting the company enron stock which traded as high as 90 in august 2000 is all but worthless after the company wrote off more than 1 billion of investments and disclosed a 1 2 billion loss in shareholder equity because of its dealings with affiliated partnerships they caused us to lose our money and they made money said steve lacey an emergency dispatcher for portland general electric enron s oregon based electric utility unit lay didn t return telephones calls seeking comment and skilling through a spokesman declined to comment lacey like many of portland general s 2 700 employees bought enron shares for his 401 k investment plan the stock which he planned on using for his retirement closed today at 40 cents lacey filed suit against enron in houston on nov 20 claiming the company prohibited employees from moving shares out of the investment plan as the stock fell in october

technology companies microsoft corp insiders among the most active sellers at any u s company sold 367 2 million shares worth 31 4 billion since 1990 records show in the past year microsoft insiders sold 3 6 million shares for 222 million biggest seller in all 60 officers directors and trusts they control sold enron stock during the past decade lou pai former chairman of enron s newpower holdings inc made the most from selling enron shares during the past decade pai sold 3 89 million shares for 270 3 million most of pai s sales were made last year at prices ranging from 50 52 to 78 17 a share pai couldn t be reached immediately for comment ken harrison former chairman and ceo of portland general sold almost 992 000 shares for 78 million enron bought the utility in 1997 for 3 1 billion in stock and debt harrison also couldn t be reached immediately for comment it would seem that insiders had some advance warning that there were better opportunities said david coleman editor of vickers weekly insider report the selling among enron insiders outweighed the buying during the past decade in all insiders bought almost 488 000 shares paying a total of 20 7 million the last executive to buy enron s stock former chief financial officer andrew fastow who bought 10 000 shares on aug 16 at 36 98 according to the washington service fastow was ousted in late october after the sec began an investigation into enron s accounting and its use of investment partnerships enron restated earnings for almost five years in october wiping out 586 million in profits as it accounted for losses from the partnerships fastow couldn t be reached for comment loren steffy in dallas 214 954 9453 or steffy bloomberg net u s banks enron debt is overstated analysts say updatel 2001 12 03 16 54 new york u s banks enron debt is overstated analysts say updatel updates with closing stock prices new york dec 3 bloomberg enron corp says it owes citigroup inc j p morgan chase co and bank of new york co 7 55 billion in the largest bankruptcy case in u s history analysts say the amount owed the banks may be less than half that here s where they differ enron yesterday said in court papers it owed thousands of creditors 31 2 billion in loans unpaid bills and other debts citigroup the biggest creditor is owed 3 billion stemming from a loan it arranged last year enron said still the banks probably hold only a fraction of the debts enron says they re owed that s because banks routinely sell parts of loans to other lenders as a way to disperse risk banks also are listed as the holders of bonds and other securities that in fact are owned by investors the banks are listed as the creditors in enron s papers it s very difficult to piece together the reality said robert napoli an analyst at abn amro inc who owns citigroup shares they ve syndicated out a portion of the loan and they could have hedged the credit risk through derivatives citigroup the largest u s financial services company is probably owed 1 billion at most analysts say and much of that is backed by collateral such as gas pipelines on which it should be able to collect the company s profit may be lowered by between 250 million and 500 million before taxes or between 3 cents and 5 cents a share after taxes as a result of its involvement with enron said napoli who recommends investors buy citigroup shares citigroup earned 2 08 a share in the first nine months of the year hurting earnings j p morgan chase which enron says is owed 2 1 billion says its exposure totals about 900 million 500 million unsecured and 400 million backed by collateral that exposure could result in a 15 cent decline in earnings per share said goldman sachs co analyst richard strauss the second largest u s bank earned 1 54 a share so far this year j p morgan chase acts as a representative for holders of enron bonds so while the company is listed by enron as a creditor on 1 9 billion of bonds it may not be owed a cent on that debt enron s 2 45 billion debt to bank of new york may work in much the same way said lehman brothers analyst henry dickson he estimated the bank is owed about 50 million much of j p morgan s exposure is tied to citigroup s 3 billion loan to enron a credit enron doesn t even mention a syndicate of at least five other banks including j p morgan chase contributed to that loan according to bloomberg data as lead arranger citigroup likely holds about 10 percent of the loan meaning its exposure is about 300 million j p morgan chase s share of that is likely less bank of america corp commerzbank ag and barclays bank plc are among other enron lenders not listed as creditors still concern that the banks losses may exceed forecasts helped send their shares and bonds lower today citigroup shares fell 99

weekend in attacks by palestinian suicide bombers in jerusalem and the northern israeli port city of haifa on monday israel fired nine missiles near palestinian leader yasser arafat s headquarters in gaza city in an apparent retaliation the violence overseas detracted from some fairly upbeat readings on the u s economy including a report from the commerce department that consumer spending rose by a record 2 9 in october robust spending on cars and other big ticket items contributed to the reading s largest jump since 1959 when the data series began the previous record had been a 2 6 increase in september 1987 personal income was virtually unchanged for the second month in a row roughly in line with economists forecasts the commerce department also surprised economists by reporting a 1 9

meanwhile a closely watched index of manufacturing activity rose more than expected in november the national association of purchasing management reported monday that its purchasing managers index rose to 44 5 last month from 39 8 in october economists have been forecasting the pmi would rise to 42 a pmi reading of 42 7 is considered the threshold between expansion and contraction in the wider economy so november s pmi of 44 5 suggests that the economy is growing albeit slowly last week the national bureau of economic research formally declared that the country had entered a recession back in march ending the longest period of economic expansion in u s history the government reported that total economic activity fell at an annual rate of 1 1 in the july september quarter against this backdrop analysts called the latest napm data encouraging after absorbing last month s aftershock of the terrorist attacks the manufacturing sector showed surprising resilience in november norbert ore director of the survey said in a statement the trend is definitely in the right direction but it is too soon to claim an imminent recovery based on this report the sector regained a significant portion of the output lost in october mr ore said matthew freedman an economist at economy com said the napm report shows that the deterioration in manufacturing appears to be slowing quite dramatically but the stronger than expected numbers did little to comfort investors who have been scrutinizing economic readings in recent weeks for signs that the business cycle has hit bottom the markets are especially interested to see if rising levels of unemployment will put a dent in consumer spending which is considered a key to keeping the current economic recession a mild one most major

northwest expects to soon file a similar request with the u s securities and exchange commission a company spokesman said the purchase is unrelated to the status of enron s northern natural gas pipeline to which dynegy inc is claiming rights after canceling a bid to purchase enron last week portland ore based northwest natural gas is a local natural gas distribution company that serves about 530 000 customers in oregon and washington it is oregon s largest natural gas utility while portland general is the state s biggest electric utility northwest filed for approval with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc on friday after a similar application with the oregon public utilities commission on nov 28 with a response requested by may 15 2002 the oregon commission s watershed approval would allow northwest to take operational control of portland general by the end of 2002 said northwest spokesman jim boehlke northwest said it wants ferc to act on its request by feb 20 2002 enron s declaration of bankruptcy over the weekend could complicate things for northwest s plans for portland general boehlke said but northwest is going forward with the purchase without regard for what it going on in the enron bankruptcy proceedings he said a bankruptcy court is likely to look favorably on northwest s purchase boehlke said because it will give enron cash to pay debts we re about to give enron 1 55 billion dollars in cash hopefully a bankruptcy court would want that to go forward he said the deal also includes 50 million in common stock and 200 million in special preferred stock he said portland general serves 733 000 oregon customers owns 26 000 miles of transmission and distribution lines and 2 015 megawatts of generation one megawatt is enough to power roughly 1 000 homes after purchasing portland general in 1997 enron agreed to sell it to sierra pacific resources corp for 2 1 billion in 1999 but that deal was abandoned in april after regulators in california and nevada barred sierra pacific from divesting generation assets in those states which it needed to finance its purchase state regulators took action after a power shortage in the wester united states sent prices skyrocketing and made states rethink plans to deregulate their electricity markets including asset divestitures that allowed northwest to move ahead with its own purchase plans ferc will rule on whether the combination has an adverse impact on competition and northwest does not expect ferc or other regulators to raise substantive issues boehlke said copyright 2000 dow

billion in the largest bankruptcy case in u s history analysts say the amount owed the banks may be less than half that here s where they differ enron yesterday said in court papers it owed thousands of creditors 31 2 billion in loans unpaid bills and other debts citigroup the biggest creditor is owed 3 billion stemming from a loan it arranged last year enron said still the banks probably hold only a fraction of the debts enron says they re owed that s because banks routinely sell parts of loans to other lenders as a way to disperse risk banks also are listed as the holders of bonds and other securities that in fact are owned by investors the banks are listed as the creditors in enron s papers it s very difficult to piece together the reality said robert napoli an analyst at abn amro inc who owns citigroup shares they ve syndicated out a portion of the loan and they could have hedged the credit risk through derivatives citigroup the largest u s financial services company is probably owed 1 billion at most analysts say and much of that is backed by collateral such as gas pipelines on which it should be able to collect the company s profit may be lowered by between 250 million and 500 million before taxes or between 3 cents and 5 cents a share after taxes as a result of its involvement with enron said napoli who recommends investors buy citigroup shares citigroup earned 2 08 a share in the first nine months of the year hurting earnings j p morgan chase which enron says is owed 2 1 billion says its exposure totals about 900 million 500 million unsecured and 400 million backed by collateral that exposure could result in a 15 cent decline in earnings per share said goldman sachs co analyst richard strauss the second largest u s bank earned 1 54 a share so far this year j p morgan chase acts as a representative for holders of enron bonds so while the company is listed by enron as a creditor on 1 9 billion of bonds it may not be owed a cent on that debt enron s 2 45 billion debt to bank of new york may work in much the same way said lehman brothers analyst henry dickson he estimated the bank is owed about 50 million much of j p morgan s exposure is tied to citigroup s 3 billion loan to enron a credit enron doesn t even mention a syndicate of at least five other banks including j p morgan chase contributed to that loan according to bloomberg data as lead arranger citigroup likely holds about 10 percent of the loan meaning its exposure is about 300 million j p morgan chase s share of that is likely less bank of america corp commerzbank ag and barclays bank plc are among other enron lenders not listed as creditors still concern that the banks losses may exceed forecasts helped send their shares and bonds lower today citigroup shares fell 99

weekend in attacks by palestinian suicide bombers in jerusalem and the northern israeli port city of haifa on monday israel fired nine missiles near palestinian leader yasser arafat s headquarters in gaza city in an apparent retaliation the violence overseas detracted from some fairly upbeat readings on the u s economy including a report from the commerce department that consumer spending rose by a record 2 9 in october robust spending on cars and other big ticket items contributed to the reading s largest jump since 1959 when the data series began the previous record had been a 2 6 increase in september 1987 personal income was virtually unchanged for the second month in a row roughly in line with economists forecasts the commerce department also surprised economists by reporting a 1 9

rose to 44 5 last month from 39 8 in october economists have been forecasting the pmi would rise to 42 a pmi reading of 42 7 is considered the threshold between expansion and contraction in the wider economy so november s pmi of 44 5 suggests that the economy is growing albeit slowly last week the national bureau of economic research formally declared that the country had entered a recession back in march ending the longest period of economic expansion in u s history the government reported that total economic activity fell at an annual rate of 1 1 in the july september quarter against this backdrop analysts called the latest napm data encouraging after absorbing last month s aftershock of the terrorist attacks the manufacturing sector showed surprising resilience in november norbert ore director of the survey said in a statement the trend is definitely in the right direction but it is too soon to claim an imminent recovery based on this report the sector regained a significant portion of the output lost in october mr ore said matthew freedman an economist at economy com said the napm report shows that the deterioration in manufacturing appears to be slowing quite dramatically but the stronger than expected numbers did little to comfort investors who have been scrutinizing economic readings in recent weeks for signs that the business cycle has hit bottom the markets are especially interested to see if rising levels of unemployment will put a dent in consumer spending which is considered a key to keeping the current economic recession a mild one most major

northwest expects to soon file a similar request with the u s securities and exchange commission a company spokesman said the purchase is unrelated to the status of enron s northern natural gas pipeline to which dynegy inc is claiming rights after canceling a bid to purchase enron last week portland ore based northwest natural gas is a local natural gas distribution company that serves about 530 000 customers in oregon and washington it is oregon s largest natural gas utility while portland general is the state s biggest electric utility northwest filed for approval with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc on friday after a similar application with the oregon public utilities commission on nov 28 with a response requested by may 15 2002 the oregon commission s watershed approval would allow northwest to take operational control of portland general by the end of 2002 said northwest spokesman jim boehlke northwest said it wants ferc to act on its request by feb 20 2002 enron s declaration of bankruptcy over the weekend could complicate things for northwest s plans for portland general boehlke said but northwest is going forward with the purchase without regard for what it going on in the enron bankruptcy proceedings he said a bankruptcy court is likely to look favorably on northwest s purchase boehlke said because it will give enron cash to pay debts we re about to give enron 1 55 billion dollars in cash hopefully a bankruptcy court would want that to go forward he said the deal also includes 50 million in common stock and 200 million in special preferred stock he said portland general serves 733 000 oregon customers owns 26 000 miles of transmission and distribution lines and 2 015 megawatts of generation one megawatt is enough to power roughly 1 000 homes after purchasing portland general in 1997 enron agreed to sell it to sierra pacific resources corp for 2 1 billion in 1999 but that deal was abandoned in april after regulators in california and nevada barred sierra pacific from divesting generation assets in those states which it needed to finance its purchase state regulators took action after a power shortage in the wester united states sent prices skyrocketing and made states rethink plans to deregulate their electricity markets including asset divestitures that allowed northwest to move ahead with its own purchase plans ferc will rule on whether the combination has an adverse impact on competition and northwest does not expect ferc or other regulators to raise substantive issues boehlke said copyright 2000 dow

protection yesterday from creditors in a bankruptcy that was the largest in u s history the company is in talks with financial institutions to fund the wholesale trading business under new ownership chief operating officer greg whalley said in a statement until we ve seen the fallout from this bankruptcy i don t think you re going to find a lot of entities that are prepared to trade with enron said daniel gordon head of commodities trading at hagerstown maryland based allegheny energy inc which owns utilities in five states anyone who thinks this will be a quick bankruptcy is deluding themselves houston based enron has lost 26 billion in market value since mid october when the company restated 586 million in earnings and disclosed that its executives may have profited from enron s dealings with affiliated partnerships that bought enron assets enron which was the buyer or seller on every transaction on its web site handles only a fraction of the trades it once did the company said today it will fire 4 000 workers in houston difficult to resurrect the wholesale trading business of enrononline which had been a valuable property has for all practical purposes ceased operation and in a post bankruptcy scenario may in fact be difficult to resurrect fitch inc a chicago based firm that rates corporate credit said in a report today trading has surged in markets that compete with enron including the new york mercantile exchange and intercontinental exchange inc dynegy inc chief executive officer chuck watson said his company s energy trading web site has seen increased

enron said friday it would fire more than 1 000 workers in europe shutdown enrononline shut down wednesday after dynegy canceled its plans to buy enron depriving enron of the cash it needed to meet

offerings according to company officials on thursday the site logged 825 trades down from the normal amount of about 5 000 we re actively trading enron spokesman eric thode said today declining to elaborate there may still be trading going on but it s primarily to unwind positions fitch credit analyst ralph pellecchia said it s certainly not new growth or for profitability for all intents and purposes enron s horsepower its earnings generating machine has been effectively shut down needs capital enron declined to name the leading financial institutions it is in talks with to provide new capital for the trading business if these discussions are successful they could result in the creation of a new trading entity with a strong and unencumbered balance sheet whalley said we understand that it may take time for counterparties to resume normal trading levels with this entity but we are confident that this business can be put back on a solid footing enron s top creditors include

merritt said williams cos which controls 27 000 miles of pipes stopped shipping enron s gas last week enron has lost all credibility fusaro said in the meantime some traders that had become accustomed to the ease and speed of online transactions are finding it difficult to adjust kevin cokinos co owner and vice president at cokinos energy corp in houston said he has had to rely on his old network of telephone brokers for price quotes rather than enron s web site it s hard to do as many deals because you re spending so much more time on each one said cokinos whose company trades about 500

stock and debt harrison also couldn t be reached immediately for comment it would seem that insiders had some advance warning that there were better opportunities said david coleman editor of vickers weekly insider report the selling among enron insiders outweighed the buying during the past decade in all insiders bought almost 488 000 shares paying a total of 20 7 million the last executive to buy enron s stock former chief financial officer andrew fastow who bought 10 000 shares on aug 16 at 36 98 according to the washington service fastow was ousted in late october after the sec began an

s banks enron debt is overstated analysts say updatel updates with closing stock prices new york dec 3 bloomberg enron corp says it owes citigroup inc j p morgan chase co and bank of new york co 7 55 billion in the largest bankruptcy case in u s history analysts say the amount owed the banks may be less than half that here s where they differ enron yesterday said in court papers it owed thousands of creditors 31 2 billion in loans unpaid bills and other debts citigroup the biggest creditor is owed 3 billion stemming from a loan it arranged last year enron said still the banks probably hold only a fraction of the debts enron says they re owed that s because banks routinely sell parts of loans to other lenders as a way to disperse risk banks also are listed as the holders of bonds and other securities that in fact are owned by investors the banks are listed as the creditors in enron s papers it s very difficult to piece together the reality said robert napoli an analyst at abn amro inc who owns citigroup shares they ve syndicated out a portion of the loan and they could have hedged the credit risk through derivatives citigroup the largest u s financial services company is probably owed 1 billion at most analysts say and much of that is backed by collateral such as gas pipelines on which it should be able to collect the company s profit may be lowered by between 250 million and 500 million before taxes or between 3 cents and 5 cents a share after taxes as a result of its involvement with enron said napoli who recommends investors buy citigroup shares citigroup earned 2 08 a share in the first nine months of the year hurting earnings j p morgan chase which enron says is owed 2 1 billion says its exposure totals about 900 million 500 million unsecured and 400 million backed by collateral that exposure could result in a 15 cent decline in earnings per share said goldman sachs co analyst richard strauss the second largest u s bank earned 1 54 a share so far this year j p morgan chase acts as a representative for holders of enron bonds so while the company is listed by enron as a creditor on 1 9 billion of bonds it may not be owed a cent on that debt enron s 2 45 billion debt to bank of new york may work in much the same way said lehman brothers analyst henry dickson he estimated the bank is owed about 50 million much of j p morgan s exposure is tied to citigroup s 3 billion loan to enron a credit enron doesn t even mention a syndicate of at least five other banks including j p morgan chase contributed to that loan according to bloomberg data as lead arranger citigroup likely holds about 10 percent of the loan meaning its exposure is about 300 million j p morgan chase s share of that is likely less bank of america corp commerzbank ag and barclays bank plc are among other enron lenders not listed as creditors still concern that the banks losses may exceed forecasts helped send their shares and bonds lower today citigroup shares fell 99

the euro concerns over the fallout from the weekend s suicide bombings in israel damped any beneficial effects from economic reports that exceeded wall street s expectations the events in israel have created a lot of uncertainty said peter coolidge senior equity trader at brean murray co that more than counteracts any positive news on the economic front at least 25 people were killed over the weekend in attacks by palestinian suicide bombers in jerusalem and the northern israeli port city of haifa on monday israel fired nine missiles near palestinian leader yasser arafat s headquarters in gaza city in an apparent retaliation the violence overseas detracted from some fairly upbeat readings on the u s economy including a report from the commerce department that consumer spending rose by a record 2 9 in october robust spending on cars and other big ticket items contributed to the reading s largest jump since 1959 when the data series began the previous record had been a 2 6 increase in september 1987 personal income was virtually unchanged for the second month in a row roughly in line with economists forecasts the commerce department also surprised economists by reporting a 1 9 increase in total construction spending for october forecasts had that figure falling by 0 5 september construction spending was revised to show a 0 7 drop from the 0 4 decline previously reported meanwhile a closely watched index of manufacturing activity rose more than expected in november the national association of purchasing management reported monday that its purchasing managers index rose to 44 5 last month from 39 8 in october economists have been forecasting the pmi would rise to 42 a pmi reading of 42 7 is considered the threshold between expansion and contraction in the wider economy so november s pmi of 44 5 suggests that the economy is growing albeit slowly last week the national bureau of economic research formally declared that the country had entered a recession back in march ending the longest period of economic expansion in u s history the government reported that total economic activity fell at an annual rate of 1 1 in the july september quarter against this backdrop analysts called the latest napm data encouraging after absorbing last month s aftershock of the terrorist attacks the manufacturing sector showed surprising resilience in november norbert ore director of the survey said in a statement the trend is definitely in the right direction but it is too soon to claim an imminent recovery based on this report the sector regained a significant portion of the output lost in october mr ore said matthew freedman an economist at economy com said the napm report shows that the deterioration in manufacturing appears to be slowing quite dramatically but the stronger than expected numbers did little to comfort investors who have been scrutinizing economic readings in recent weeks for signs that the business cycle has hit bottom the markets are especially interested to see if rising levels of unemployment will put a dent in consumer spending which is considered a key to keeping the current economic recession a mild one most major

northwest expects to soon file a similar request with the u s securities and exchange commission a company spokesman said the purchase is unrelated to the status of enron s northern natural gas pipeline to which dynegy inc is claiming rights after canceling a bid to purchase enron last week portland ore based northwest natural gas is a local natural gas distribution company that serves about 530 000 customers in oregon and washington it is oregon s largest natural gas utility while portland general is the state s biggest electric utility northwest filed for approval with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc on friday after a similar application with the oregon public utilities commission on nov 28 with a response requested by may 15 2002 the oregon commission s watershed approval would allow northwest to take operational control of portland general by the end of 2002 said northwest spokesman jim boehlke northwest said it wants ferc to act on its request by feb 20 2002 enron s declaration of bankruptcy over the weekend could complicate things for northwest s plans for portland general boehlke said but northwest is going forward with the purchase without regard for what it going on in the enron bankruptcy proceedings he said a bankruptcy court is likely to look favorably on northwest s purchase boehlke said because it will give enron cash to pay debts we re about to give enron 1 55 billion dollars in cash hopefully a bankruptcy court would want that to go forward he said the deal also includes 50 million in common stock and 200 million in special preferred stock he said portland general serves 733 000 oregon customers owns 26 000 miles of transmission and distribution lines and 2 015 megawatts of generation one megawatt is enough to power roughly 1 000 homes after purchasing portland general in 1997 enron agreed to sell it to sierra pacific resources corp for 2 1 billion in 1999 but that deal was abandoned in april after regulators in california and nevada barred sierra pacific from divesting generation assets in those states which it needed to finance its purchase state regulators took action after a power shortage in the wester united states sent prices skyrocketing and made states rethink plans to deregulate their electricity markets including asset divestitures that allowed northwest to move ahead with its own purchase plans ferc will rule on whether the combination has an adverse impact on competition and northwest does not expect ferc or other regulators to raise substantive issues boehlke said copyright 2000 dow

billion in the largest bankruptcy case in u s history analysts say the amount owed the banks may be less than half that here s where they differ enron yesterday said in court papers it owed thousands of creditors 31 2 billion in loans unpaid bills and other debts citigroup the biggest creditor is owed 3 billion stemming from a loan it arranged last year enron said still the banks probably hold only a fraction of the debts enron says they re owed that s because banks routinely sell parts of loans to other lenders as a way to disperse risk banks also are listed as the holders of bonds and other securities that in fact are owned by investors the banks are listed as the creditors in enron s papers it s very difficult to piece together the reality said robert napoli an analyst at abn amro inc who owns citigroup shares they ve syndicated out a portion of the loan and they could have hedged the credit risk through derivatives citigroup the largest u s financial services company is probably owed 1 billion at most analysts say and much of that is backed by collateral such as gas pipelines on which it should be able to collect the company s profit may be lowered by between 250 million and 500 million before taxes or between 3 cents and 5 cents a share after taxes as a result of its involvement with enron said napoli who recommends investors buy citigroup shares citigroup earned 2 08 a share in the first nine months of the year hurting earnings j p morgan chase which enron says is owed 2 1 billion says its exposure totals about 900 million 500 million unsecured and 400 million backed by collateral that exposure could result in a 15 cent decline in earnings per share said goldman sachs co analyst richard strauss the second largest u s bank earned 1 54 a share so far this year j p morgan chase acts as a representative for holders of enron bonds so while the company is listed by enron as a creditor on 1 9 billion of bonds it may not be owed a cent on that debt enron s 2 45 billion debt to bank of new york may work in much the same way said lehman brothers analyst henry dickson he estimated the bank is owed about 50 million much of j p morgan s exposure is tied to citigroup s 3 billion loan to enron a credit enron doesn t even mention a syndicate of at least five other banks including j p morgan chase contributed to that loan according to bloomberg data as lead arranger citigroup likely holds about 10 percent of the loan meaning its exposure is about 300 million j p morgan chase s share of that is likely less bank of america corp commerzbank ag and

the euro concerns over the fallout from the weekend s suicide bombings in israel damped any beneficial effects from economic reports that exceeded wall street s expectations the events in israel have created a lot of uncertainty said peter coolidge senior equity trader at brean murray co that more than counteracts any positive news on the economic front at least 25 people were killed over the weekend in attacks by palestinian suicide bombers in jerusalem and the northern israeli port city of haifa on monday israel fired nine missiles near palestinian leader yasser arafat s headquarters in gaza city in an apparent retaliation the violence overseas detracted from some fairly upbeat readings on the u s economy including a report from the commerce department that consumer spending rose by a record 2 9 in october robust spending on cars and other big ticket items contributed to the reading s largest jump since 1959 when the data series began the previous record had been a 2 6 increase in september 1987 personal income was virtually unchanged for the second month in a row roughly in line with economists forecasts the commerce department also surprised economists by reporting a 1 9 increase in total construction spending for october forecasts had that figure falling by 0 5 september construction spending was revised to show a 0 7 drop from the 0 4 decline previously reported meanwhile a closely watched index of manufacturing activity rose more than expected in november the national association of purchasing management reported monday that its purchasing managers index rose to 44 5 last month from 39 8 in october economists have been forecasting the pmi would rise to 42 a pmi reading of 42 7 is considered the threshold between expansion and contraction in the wider economy so november s pmi of 44 5 suggests that the economy is growing albeit slowly last week the national bureau of economic research formally declared that the country had entered a recession back in march ending the longest period of economic expansion in u s history the government reported that total economic activity fell at an annual rate of 1 1 in the july september quarter against this backdrop analysts called the latest napm data encouraging after absorbing last month s aftershock of the terrorist attacks the manufacturing sector showed surprising resilience in november norbert ore director of the survey said in a statement the trend is definitely in the right direction but it is too soon to claim an imminent recovery based on this report the sector regained a significant portion of the output lost in october mr ore said matthew freedman an economist at economy com said the napm report shows that the deterioration in manufacturing appears to be slowing quite dramatically but the stronger than expected numbers did little to comfort investors who have been scrutinizing economic readings in recent weeks for signs that the business cycle has hit bottom the markets are especially interested to see if rising levels of unemployment will put a dent in consumer spending which is considered a key to keeping the current economic recession a mild one most major

filing the largest in u s history continued to pull stocks lower on monday but others said it was largely expected and was having little effect on share prices it could hurt the markets somewhere down

reuters limited 2001 washington dec 3 reuters northwest natural gas co said monday it asked approval from federal energy regulators to buy portland general electric co from enron corp for 1 8 billion northwest expects to soon file a similar request with the u s securities and exchange commission a company spokesman said the purchase is unrelated to the status of enron s northern natural gas pipeline to which dynegy inc is claiming rights after canceling a bid to purchase enron last week portland ore based northwest natural gas is a local natural gas distribution company that serves about 530 000 customers in oregon and washington it is oregon s largest natural gas utility while portland general is the state s biggest electric utility northwest filed for approval with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc on friday after a similar application with the oregon public utilities commission on nov 28 with a response requested by may 15 2002 the oregon commission s watershed approval would allow northwest to take operational control of portland general by the end of 2002 said northwest spokesman jim boehlke northwest said it wants ferc to act on its request by feb 20 2002 enron s declaration of bankruptcy over the weekend could complicate things for northwest s plans for portland general boehlke said but northwest is going forward with the purchase without regard for what it going on in the enron bankruptcy proceedings he said a bankruptcy court is likely to look favorably on northwest s purchase boehlke said because it will give enron cash to pay debts we re about to give enron 1 55 billion dollars in cash hopefully a bankruptcy court would want that to go forward he said the deal also includes 50 million in common stock and 200 million in special preferred stock he said portland general serves 733 000 oregon customers owns 26 000 miles of transmission and distribution lines and 2 015 megawatts of generation one megawatt is enough to power roughly 1 000 homes after purchasing portland general in 1997 enron agreed to sell it to sierra pacific resources corp for 2 1 billion in 1999 but that deal was abandoned in april after regulators in california and nevada barred sierra pacific from divesting generation assets in those states which it needed to finance its purchase state regulators took action after a power shortage in the wester united states sent prices skyrocketing and made states rethink plans to deregulate their electricity markets including asset divestitures that allowed northwest to move ahead with its own purchase plans ferc will rule on whether the combination has an adverse impact on competition and northwest does not expect ferc or other regulators to raise substantive issues boehlke said copyright 2000 dow
